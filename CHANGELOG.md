# 0.0.2

- Added support for short commands (e.g., `-c` for `--current-path`, `-g` for `--generated-class-key`).
- Improved handling of `LocaleKeys.key` in the `KeyUsageVisitor` to support direct usage without method invocations.
- Fixed lint issues by ensuring all lines are within the 80-character limit.
